# SYSC3303 - Real Time Concurrent Systems

## Description
This repository contains projects focused on object oriented programming in Java. The projects included apply real time programming concepts such as:
- UDP Inter-process communication
- Multi-threaded programming (Parallel Programming)
- Real Time scheduling theories
  - Sub Process-based scheduling, Cyclic executives
  - Sub Utilization based scheduling, Rate-monotonic analysis
  - Sub Priority-based scheduling
- Performance analysis of multithreaded applications
