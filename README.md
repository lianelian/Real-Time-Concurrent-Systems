- UDP inter-process communication
- Multi-threaded programming (Parallel Programming)
- Real Time scheduling theories
  - Process-based scheduling, Cyclic executives
  - Utilization based scheduling, Rate-monotonic analysis
  - Priority-based scheduling
- Performance analysis of multithreaded applications
